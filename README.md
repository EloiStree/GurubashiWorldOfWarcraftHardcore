# Gurubashi World of Warcraft Hardcore

**GWWH** is a concept for a custom server where coders can learn programming by playing in a free-for-all hardcore World of Warcraft environment.

The idea is simple: **teach coding through gameplay.**
I’m not interested in tokens, gold farming, or accidentally creating bot-training tools.

I just want to make coding fun by combining it with World of Warcraft.

The envisioned server would be a **free-for-all PvP world with hardcore rules**—you level up, you explore, you fight, but any encounter could end permanently if you die.

If you know how to setup this kind of server, contact me.   
  
You are on Fiverr and want to help me with this code tournament server.   
Feel free to contact me. I am poor, but I don’t mind eating pasta for a month if it can bring this server alive.  


**Rules:**   
- PVP Free for all enable anywhere.
- Human player allowed 😋(server to learn code... So 90%+ are bots)
- Xp Level are 800%
- No cheat and bug abuse allowed
- Hardcore server 

## Dream-Freature: King Guild system

For every guild on the server there is a permanent player.
- If the king die -> Guild is deleted
- If the king is unconnected for more that 5 minutes -> Guild is deleted
- If the king is diconnect to avoid combat -> GM delete the guild.
- If a king enter a donjour -> Guild is deleted
- When a king die all the guild item are transfert by mail to the player killing him.

Basically this feature is there to have fun.
