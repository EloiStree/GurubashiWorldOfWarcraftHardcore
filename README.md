# Gurubashi World of Warcraft Hardcore

**GWWH** is a concept for a custom server where coders can learn programming by playing in a free-for-all hardcore World of Warcraft environment.

The idea is simple: **teach coding through gameplay.**  
I’m not interested in tokens, gold farming,...  
I just want to create a World of War-Craft.  

My goal to make coding fun by combining it with World of Warcraft PvP orianted.

The envisioned server would be a **free-for-all PvP world with hardcore rules**—you level up, you explore, you fight, then you die.



**Rules:**   
- PVP Free for all enable anywhere.
- Hardcore server 
- Xp Level are 800%
- Human player tolarated 😋
- No cheat and bug abuse allowed

**Teacher:**
_No commercial will on this project except education._  
The aim is to teach offline as LAN server with a classroom.  
Sometime time open the port to test around it.   

**Main focus of the workshop:**
- Learn to move and rotate in a MMo
- Learn to make code that can live their own life
