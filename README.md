> **Warning 1:** Private servers are against the World of Warcraft Terms of Service.  
> You please have an active monthly subscription to the official game to participate in those servers mode.  
> This is not, and should not be, a substitute for the official release.  
> This project is a fan-made mode for educational purposes.  
> *We are not against Blizzard; we just want to have fun in the world we were born in.*  

---

> **Warning 2:** All bots on World of Warcraft public servers should be banned, hunted, and reported.  
> But outside of public servers, and bots hunting , I truly believe in the educational purpose of coding your way through the game.  
> Servers dedicated to learning to code should exist, similar to **Minecraft Education**.  
> By creating bots, you learn how to fight them and how to make their lives harder.   
> *The Gurubashi servers are here for that: to learn to code while having fun.*  

---

> **Note:** We fight an unequal battle with bots because they don’t sleep and they have numbers.   
> But by reporting some of them, Blizzard can track back many of them, observe, and remove them.  
> I won’t lie, I started creating bots because:    
> * Killing 30,000 mobs or fishing for a week straight for a mount is inhuman.    
> * I don’t have $80 to boost a character or three weeks of my life to kill boars (with the auto-leveling).    
> * My favorite sport on public servers is to make white-hat bots run around the world to find bots to report them all.    
> *So if you bot on public servers, at least try to be a good bot for the community.*

### **Why be here:**

* If you’re here to learn what a `loop` and a `list` are, you’re in the right place.
* If you want to battle as a human against code and AI in mini-challenge tournaments, you’re in the right place.
* If you want to learn how to create a home server and practice coding by fighting your friends in LAN PvP, you’re in the right place.

> Don't get attached to your champion. Craft your gear; you are here for the war.

**GWWH** is a concept for a custom server where coders can learn programming by playing in a free-for-all hardcore PVP World of Warcraft environment.

The idea is simple: **teach coding through gameplay.**  
I’m not interested in tokens, gold farming, and illegal services,...  
I just want to experiment a World of **War**-**Craft**.  

The envisioned server is **free-for-all PvP world with hardcore rules**:  
you level up, you explore, you fight, then you die. Repeat.  
_The aim is to be short session to learn fast but also can become big sesions when you need to preserve your life._


My hope is that if this initiative ever comes to an end, it will be because it is made official, not removed.  
The concept is simple and fun.  

**Rules:**   
- PVP Free for all enable anywhere.
- Hardcore server: When you die, you die. 
- Xp Level are 800%: To avoid beeing stuck at level 5
- Human player are welcome.
- No cheat and bug abuse allowed
- We respect Blizzard on the server
- We respect https://github.com/azerothcore

**Teacher:**  
_No commercial will on this project except education around coding_   
The only aim, beside PVP-tournament-for-fun, is to bring youth to the coding world.  
Country of the world need developers and I think this initative can help on that.    

**Main focus of the workshop:**
- Learn how to code from variable to math of moving champion.
- Learn complexe code by reading webcam
- Learn be create test battery by simulating input
- Learn to collaborate with AI using API
- Learn to make clean code that can live their own life
- Learn why are data base by hosting your own server offline.
  - Learn how to use a terminal on Ubuntu and Steam OS.

In the hope that this project helps the community and brings more people to the official game,
Eloi
