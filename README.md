# Gurubashi World of Warcraft Hardcore

**GWWH** is a concept for a custom server where coders can learn programming by playing in a free-for-all hardcore World of Warcraft environment.

The idea is simple: **teach coding through gameplay.**
I’m not interested in tokens, gold farming, or accidentally creating bot-training tools.

I just want to make coding fun by combining it with World of Warcraft.

The envisioned server would be a **free-for-all PvP world with hardcore rules**—you level up, you explore, you fight, but any encounter could end permanently if you die.

If you know how to setup this kind of server, contact me.   
  
You are on Fiverr and want to help me with this code tournament server.   
Feel free to contact me. I am poor, but I don’t mind eating pasta for a month if it can bring this server alive.
