I wanted to learn how to set up a server…
But not my first one, and only if FFA Hardcore was possible.
After confirming this, he agreed to install it on a local PC that I prepared for him.
I took notes on what he did in order to build this tutorial.
Thanks to him for pulling it off.

Now it is installed, I need to learn to do it by myself on an other computer.  
Before I do that, I writing down the step and vocabulary to learn.
